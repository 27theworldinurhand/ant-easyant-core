<h3>Easyant on IRC:</h3>

We've registered an IRC channel on the freenode network for informal easyant discussions, asking questions or just hanging out and "socializing".

The channel is #easyant on irc.freenode.net.

Drop by if you are interested in the development of easyant, have a quick question or just want to get to know the people developing and using it. If you're new to IRC, be sure to learn how to get answers. A free web irc client is available here http://www.mibbit.com/.</textarea>
