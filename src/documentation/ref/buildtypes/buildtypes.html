<h1>Build Types</h1>

<p>A "Build Type" identifies at a high level how you want a single module in your project to be built.  Building a module typically includes many steps like compilation, source generation, unit testing, packaging, and build reporting.  For example, the build type <a href="build-webapp-java.html">build-webapp-java</a> compiles, tests, and packages a Java WAR file.</p>

<p>A BuildType is typically implemented as an Ant script, an Ivy descriptor, and a properties file.  The Ivy descriptor is used by EasyAnt to load the Build Type as runtime.  The Ant Script is executed whenever you build a module using that Build Type.  Most Build Type scripts simply import a set of <a href="../plugins/plugins.html">EasyAnt Plugins</a>, each plugin contributing one step to the build process.  For example, the <a href="build-std-java.html">build-std-java</a> Build Type imports the <a href="../plugins/compile-java.html">compile-java</a> plugin to compile Java sources and the <a href="../plugins/package-jar.html">package-jar</a> plugin to bundle the results as a JAR file.  A Build Type's properties file then contains default parameter settings used by the plugins; for example, the expected location of Java source and test files in a project directory.</p>
