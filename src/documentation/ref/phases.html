<h1>Understanding phases</h1>
<p>
  a phase is a kind of target with special features:
  <ul>
    <li>have no body, only dependencies</li>
    <li>dependencies are created on the fly (when a target is assigned to a phase)</li>
    <li>order of dependencies is not guaranteed</li>
    <li>are not prefixed in 'include', and never overriden</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>This is useful to make build modules easily reusable in a standard build (with standard phases), without requiring any specific orchestration.<p>
<h2>Example</h2>
module A:
<code type="xml">
<phase name="foo" description="do foo" />

<target name=":bar" phase="foo" >
  <dobar />
</target>
</code> 
module B:
<code type="xml">
<ea:include module="A"/>
<target name=":another-bar" phase="foo" >
</code> 


By calling to 
<code>
easyant foo
</code>

You will run ALL the targets bound the "foo" phase (:bar and :another-bar in my previous example)

In a module plugin it's possible to assign a target to a phase which is not declared in the build module. It makes the module dependent on the caller to declare the phase prior to the use call, and as such becomes a requirement of the module. </textarea>
